I have done the Emailer Development test with responsive as you mentioned in the github link i.e., Figma link.
Acctually i wanted to tell something about email development.
While we develop the Emailer we should not add any of the javascripts or div tags in the code. Coz there is some parameters and guidlines to develop the emailers.
If we we develope the emailers without any guidlines it will collape in some email clients i.e., outlook, gmail, apple mail, yahoo mail. 
So we always follow the proper instrutions and code according to the Litmus or Email on acid while developing the emailer. 
And i have very good experience on it and i have worked for lot of projects on email campaign development. And there is some limited width emailers we shoud follow while developing the emailers.
